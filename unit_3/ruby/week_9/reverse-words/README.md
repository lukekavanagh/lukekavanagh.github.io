## Release 0: Write [Pseudocode](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md)

## Release 1: Write your [initial solution](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md)

Once you write the solution, run the [tests](reverse_words_spec.rb). If your initial solution passes all tests, move on to the next release.

## Release 2: Translate RSpec
Translate as much of the RSpec as you can into [Driver Test Code](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/driver-code.md). Make sure your initial solution is passing all of your tests.

## Release 3: [Refactor](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md)

## Release 4: Push!
