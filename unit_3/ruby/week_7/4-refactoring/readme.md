# Refactoring for Code Readability

## Learning Competencies
- Explain what code is doing
- Refactor for clarity and readability

## Summary
Using the goals below, refactor your solution for the "Validate a Credit Card Number" challenge.

Paste the original unrefactored code in your my_solution.rb, and as you refactor, make notes of the changes you are making to achieve optimal readability. Include those notes along with the refactored version in your [my_solution.rb](my_solution.rb) file.

#### Goals of Readable Code
- Eliminate repetition by using looping and branching wisely
- Complex operations are decomposed into constituent parts
- Descriptive names for methods, variables, classes, and modules
- Methods are small and behavior is obvious
- Minimizes need for comments because the code tells you what it is doing
- Code is formatted with proper indentation for optimal readability

## Release 0: [Pseudocode](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md)

## Release 1: Comment the code
Comment each chunk of code in the original solution

## Release 2: [Refactor](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md) the solution for readability
