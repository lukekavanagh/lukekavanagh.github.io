# Drawer Debugger

## Learning Competencies
- Use error messages to correct syntax mistakes and/or drive development
- Define a method's responsibility
- Explain how classes interact with one another

## Summary

You will run into numerous error messages as a developer, so it's important to know what they mean and how to read them. The messages provide valuable information on where your program is having problems, but sometimes the messages are misleading, especially if you have little practice interpreting them. In this challenge, you need to work through the error messages until the program runs properly.

You may want to review ruby's attr_reader for this challenge.

## Release 0: Indent the code properly

## Release 1: Debug the program
Run the code from the console. You should encounter 8 errors before it will run completely. Read each error carefully and fix it. Only one error should be fixed by adding code to the driver code. For everything else, you should only modify the classes.

## Release 2: Test!
Write tests using [Driver Test Code](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/driver-code.md)

## Release 3: Push your solution to GitHub
