#U3.W8-9: Regular Expressions

## Learning Competencies
- Learn about regular expressions
- Use built-in methods of the String class to use regular expressions in .NET

## Summary:


C#'s `String` class has over [50 public methods](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string(v=vs.110).aspx) that give C# programmers a remarkable power to process, manipulate, and transform textual data. About a dozen of those `String` methods use Regular Expressions in order to allow for high-powered string matching. (Try searching for "regular expression" on the C# docs `String` page.)

An example of low-powered string matching is when you use your browser's search for a specific word, say, your own name. What if you wanted to search your browser for anything that matches the pattern for a telephone number? For that, you'd use Regular Expressions.

As you work through the exercises of this challenge, we recommend you use [http://derekslager.com/blog/posts/2007/09/a-better-dotnet-regular-expression-tester.ashx](http://derekslager.com/blog/posts/2007/09/a-better-dotnet-regular-expression-tester.ashx) to help you code your regex.

## Release 0: Open the exercise page in NET REPL
Go to the [relevant exercise](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/38) page in NET REPL. Pay attention to the explanation and requirements out-lined at the top of the file.

## Release 1: [Pseudocode](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md) 
*commit your changes*

## Release 2: [Initial Solution](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md) 
Write your initial solution in C# and make sure it passes all the tests. Press the "Compile and Test!" button and that will run your code and test it against the specific test units. You pass all the tests when you get all green text, otherwise it will explain which test case is failing.

*commit your changes*

## Release 3: [Refactored Solution](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md) 
*commit your changes*

## Release 4:  [Reflect](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md) 

Include your reflection in the appropriate section in your `my_solution.cs` file. ***NOTE: Reflections are mandatory!*** Commit your changes!

## Release 5: Commit and Push your changes to Github
When you feel confident with your solution, push your changes through the command line to your repo on GitHub. 
If you have done this successfully, you should be able to see your new code on your repo on [github.com](https://github.com).

## Release 6: [Review](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md)
