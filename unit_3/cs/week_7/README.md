# Week 7: Object-Oriented Design


Last week you started creating your own objects in C#. This week you will be working with something called Object-Oriented Design. 

There are many, many books, websites, references and papers about the subject, for example:

- [Object Oriented Design Principles](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/567768/Object-Oriented-Design-Principles)
- [Object-Oriented Programming Concepts](http://www.blackwasp.co.uk/ObjectOrientedConcepts.aspx)

Those are just examples, and while they are valid it's always a good idea to do your own research and find resources that are explained in a way that works for you.

## Fetch the curriculum changes!

It's time to fetch changes from the phase-0-version-2.0 master repo to get the most-updated curriculum. Make sure you are in the master branch of your local clone.
Check where you are in your terminal first. DO NOT try fetching these changes into your [USERNAME].github.io repo. You will mess things up! Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md) for fetching changes.
