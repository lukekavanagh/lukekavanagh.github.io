# U2.W6: Drawer Debugger


## Learning Competencies
- Use error messages to correct syntax mistakes and/or drive development
- Define a method's responsibility

## Summary

You will run into numerous error messages as a developer, so it's important to know what they mean and how to read them. The messages provide valuable information on where your program is having problems, but sometimes the messages are misleading, especially if you have little practice interpreting them. In this challenge, you need to work through the error messages until the program runs properly. 

## Exercise 
Go to the [relevant exercise](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/99) page in NET REPL.  (Note the lack of tests :)...) Either use NET REPL, the command line, DotNetFiddle or other editor to make changes and compile your code. 

## Release 1: Debug the program
Run the code. You should encounter 5 errors before it will run completely (excluding the bonus - uncomment the line to work on it). Read each error carefully and fix it. 

## Release 2: Write Expectations
Write expectations as comments after each method call. What do you expect each of your method calls to return?
```cs
silverwareDrawer.ViewContents(); //=> returns -fork and -knife
```

## Release 3: Interact with the Code
Interact with the code by writing at least three more different method calls. Did they return what you expected?

## Release 4: [Reflect](https://github.com/weka-2014/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md)

## Release 5: Commit and Push your changes to Github
When you feel confident with your solution, push your changes through the command line to your repo on GitHub. 
If you have done this successfully, you should be able to see your new code on your repo on [github.com](https://github.com).

## Optimize your Learning! (Optional)
Uncomment the bonus section in the my_solution.rb file (except for the line that says bonus section) and write the code to make the driver test code run as you would expect.
