# Week 1: The Command Line, Git, + Github

This week, you will learn about and fall in love with Git, Github, and the concept of version control and collaborative coding. Enjoy!

Team Treehouse delivers content through courses, tracks and achievements. A course and track is comprised of a number of achievements. At times you may be asked to complete either a selection of achievements or an entire course. 

## To-Do:

1. Do this [Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). You can stop after "Removing A File (rm)". The rest is nice to know, but not completely necessary.
2. Setup Your Machine: [Rubyists](./ruby-computer-setup) ||   [Sharpies](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/cs-setup/README.md)
3. Complete Treehouse's [Git Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/git-basics) Course.
  - Skip any parts regarding installation.
  - Treehouse uses nano as a text editor in their videos. As you're following along, you can use sublime instead.
4. [Practice Git](./git_practice)
5. [Create a Repository](./create_a_repository)
6. [Learn to Fetch Changes from a Remote Repo](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md)
7. [Introduce Yourself](./introduce_yourself)
8. [Describe Git](my_reflection.md)
