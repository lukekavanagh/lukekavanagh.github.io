# Create a Repository

We've learned how to fork repos belonging to other folx. Now let's learn to make our own! At the same time, let's also set up a personal website for you, courtesy of github pages.

## Create a Repo + Set Up Your Personal Website

Follow the instructions in this [tutorial](https://pages.github.com/) to set up your github pages site. 
  - When the tutorial asks what git client you are using, choose "A terminal".
  - When you clone your github pages repo down, make sure not to clone it into your forked phase zero repo!

That's it! You're done! :beer:
