# Introduce Yourself

## Intro Email 

Each cohort has it's own email address, for example nativebird-2015@devacademy.co.nz. Email your cohort with the subject "self introduction" or reply to the main thread you received. In your email, include your:

- Name
- Location
- Why you're attending EDA
- What you are most excited to learn about
- When the best time for you to pair is

## Check in With Your Accountability Group
Accountability groups are designed to give you a core group of people in your cohort to lean on and learn from. You will have a challenge to connect/meet with them each week. Typically your accountability group will be your stream (C# or ruby) however, for larger cohorts, the stream may be split into two. You will find your accountablity group in the "private group" area of Slack. Private groups are visible to the group only - click on the grey person in the right hand corner to see who is in the group. While we recommend slack, as a group you could also decide to connect weekly in person, or email. You will also get the chance to work with your group on group challenges in later units, so it's important to start building relationships early. You may want to start a code review process within your accountability group as well.  
  
**Contact the people in your accountability group via email with the following information:**

- Which challenge confused you the most this week
- Which concepts you found most interesting
- The city you currently live in
- Your preferred way of connecting with the group each week (slack, hangout, email, in person, if possible).
