# Week 2: HTML + CSS

This week, you'll be completing a lot of treehouse tutorials. These tutorials are excellent, engaging, and really help to demystify HTML, CSS, and the fundamentals of web design. 

Remember that personal website you set up last week with github pages? By the end of the week, you'll know how to build that up into something quite good. Have fun!

Before starting the material for this week, make sure to [fetch all curriculum changes](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md). 

## To-Do:

1. Complete Treehouse's [How to Make a Website](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/how-to-make-a-website) course
  - Skip "Sharing a Website". We will be hosting our websites on github instead.
2. [Create Your Own Website](./create_your_own_website)

**Note**: You can do both of these simultaneously. Instead of using Treehouse's workspaces, you can follow along with sublime text. In previous cohorts, students have used the site that Treehouse has you build as a starting point for their own. Feel free to do the same.

#### Everyday
- Practice sublime text, terminal, and git shortcuts with [shortcutfoo.com](https://www.shortcutfoo.com/).

## Highly suggested, but optional: 

1. In Treehouse's [CSS Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics) course, complete the following modules:
  - The Box Model
  - Basic Layout
2. Complete Treehouse's [CSS - Beyond the Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-beyond-the-basics)
3. Complete Treehouse's [HTML Forms](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/html-forms) course
