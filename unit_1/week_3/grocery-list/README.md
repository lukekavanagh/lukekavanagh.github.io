# Model a Grocery List

## Learning Competencies:
- Create a Javascript object constructor function and implement it with a basic script
- Identify the attributes and methods of an object based on user stories

## Summary
In this challenge, you'll model a grocery list as a javascript object. You'll create an object constructor function with the necessary properties and methods of a grocery list. Then you'll instantiate a grocery list object with your object constructor function. Finally, you'll write driver code to test the functionality of your object.

If you're feeling confused, check out this [example](./js_cat.js).

## Release 0: User Stories
Think about what you want your grocery list to do. Start each statement with "As a user, I want to ..." These are what we call "user stories."

## Release 1: [Pseudocode](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md)
Based on your user stories, what does your object constructor look like? What are its attributes? What are its methods? For each method, what are your expected inputs and outputs? Write some pseudocode outlining your object constructor.

## Release 2: Write [Driver Code](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/driver-code.md)
Now you have a good idea of what your grocery list will be. You know what attributes and methods it will have. Before we create the object constructor, let's write some driver code modeling how your object should behave.

In your driver code, you will first create a grocery list with your constructor. After, you'll write code to test all the methods your object should have when completed.

## Release 3: [Initial Solution](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md)
Create your initial solution. You'll know that you're done when your driver code outputs the results you expect. 

## Release 4: [Refactor](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md) your solution
Review the code. Is it DRY? Are the names good?

## Release 5: Push your changes to Github!
