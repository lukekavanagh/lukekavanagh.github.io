# DOM Manipulation Challenge

## Learning Competencies
- Modify the appearance of the DOM using JavaScript
- Explain the DOM API and its importance to web developers
- Use HTML5 tags to make code more readable

## Summary

In this challenge, you will be using JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM).

Basically, the HTML elements and properties of the browser have been wrapped in objects that you can now manipulate with JavaScript. Technically, you can use any programming language to interact with the DOM, but it is most often done using JavaScript.

This allows you to manipulate the HTML and CSS along with other aspects of the browser on runtime. This interactivity is what makes websites so much more fun and useful than the static HTML that you used back when the web was born. If you were born back then, that is.

JavaScript has built-in functions to select and manipulate HTML and CSS, read the following tutorials to learn the tools you need to complete the challenge. Then read the following references to learn more about DOM manipulation.

**REMEMBER** Everything in this challenge should be done using vanilla JavaScript (ECMAScript 5, ECMAscript 6 should be released at the end of 2014), no JQuery should be used.

# Releases

After each change you make, refresh your html file in the browser to verify that your changes have worked. 

## Release 0: Add a Class

Add the class "done" to the #release-0 div. To verify that your code has worked, open the html file in the browser, inspect element, and look at the div to see if the class has been added.

## Release 1: Set the Display Property

Set the display property of the #release-1 div to none. This should make the div disappear.

## Release 2: Change Text

Change the inner text of the `<h1>` tag to "I completed release 2."

## Release 3: Add a Background Color

Add the background color #b163a3 to the #release-3 div. #b163a3 was [Pantone's](http://www.pantone.com/) color of the year for 2014!

## Release 4: Modify the Text Size

Select all occurrences of class .release-4 and change the text-size to 2em. You should see the font-size increase for multiple elements on the page.

## Release 5: Append HTML

Take the HTML in the template.hidden and append it to the bottom of the page. Use the [Treehouse Blog Template Tag](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/creating-reusable-markup-with-the-html-template-element) resource for help. If you've done everything right, something nice should appear at the bottom of the page.

## Release 6: Push!
