# Make Your Website Interactive!

Using what you've learned this week, add some javascript/jquery to your website. Make it interactive. Have fun. Communicate with your cohort. Help each other out. You can use [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) to test + share your code. 

At the end of the week, share your site on slack / google+. Share any tricks you learned or mistakes you made. Check out some of your peers' websites. Look at their code, see if you can tell what it's doing and how it works.
