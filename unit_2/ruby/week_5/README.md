# Week 5: Algorithms 

Last week you built up a toolkit of ruby methods. You practiced with them and gained a good intuition of how they work, what they're used for, and so on. This week you'll use that toolkit to solve some more complex problems.

If you need, you can review [these guidelines](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/submission-guidelines.md) on submitting challenges.
