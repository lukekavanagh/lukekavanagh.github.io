# Week 4: Intro to Ruby

This week you get to start Ruby! These tutorials and exercises will help you build a basic Ruby toolkit. When working through the exercises, you may find it helpful to work with others from your cohort.

If you need, you can review [these guidelines](../../../phase-0-handbook/submission-guidelines) on submitting challenges.

Before starting this week's material, be sure to [fetch all curriculum changes](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md).

## To-Do:

1. Treehouse: [Ruby Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/ruby-basics)
2. Treehouse: [Ruby Foundations](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/ruby-foundations)
  - Skip the video on installation. If ruby is not yet installed on your machine, you can refer back to these [instructions](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-version-2.0/tree/master/unit_1/week_1/ruby-computer-setup) to install Ruby and RSpec.
3. Complete these [Ruby Exercises](./exercises)

#### Everyday
- Practice touch typing in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript / jQuery with [typing.io](https://typing.io). You should be past 40wpm by the end of phase zero.
- Practice sublime text, terminal, and git shortcuts with [shortcutfoo.com](https://www.shortcutfoo.com/).

### Optional, but highly suggested:

If you have time to spare, do Codecademy's [Ruby Course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby) (up to Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas). Repetition is important when learning a new language. Getting a firm grasp of Ruby now will help you in future weeks.

## Submitting your work

- You must complete the [week's submission form](http://goo.gl/forms/2XBsRXjl4V) to turn in your work.
- The week's work is due each Sunday by 11:59pm.  

**if you do not finish by the deadline:**

- Complete an extension request by emailing your facilitator. (There are a limited number of extensions available during phase-0)
- When complete, turn it in using the [week's submission form](http://goo.gl/forms/2XBsRXjl4V)
