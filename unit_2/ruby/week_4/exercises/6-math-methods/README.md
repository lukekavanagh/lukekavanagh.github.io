# Basic Arithematical Methods

## Learning Competencies
- Define a method that accepts and uses arguments
- Apply basic Ruby methods to variables

## Summary
Define four methods which correspond to the four basic arithmetic operations:

1. `add`
2. `subtract`
3. `multiply`
4. `divide`

They should accept either integers or floating point numbers as input.  `divide` should perform floating point division.

For example,

```ruby
add(10,2)      # => 12
subtract(10,2) # => 8
multiply(10,2) # => 20
divide(10,2)   # => 5.0 (*not* 5)
```

## Releases

## Release 0: Pseudocode
Consider what you need to do to solve the challenge. You can write it down if it will help you, or you can move on to the next release.

## Release 1: Initial Solution
Code your solution in the [my_solution.rb](my_solution.rb) file.

## Release 2: Test
Run the tests to make sure your code passes!

Remember, type `rspec` followed by the spec file name (and make sure you are in the proper directory).

## Release 3: Refactor
Make any necessary changes based on the tests. Then run the tests again.

Make sure all the tests pass before moving on.

## Release 4: Publish
When your solution is passing all of the tests, commit and push your changes!
