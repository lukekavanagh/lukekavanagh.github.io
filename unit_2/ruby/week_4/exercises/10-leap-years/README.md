# Leap Year

## Learning Competencies
- Define local variables and methods
- Use conditional statements
- Apply string, array, hash, and/or enumerable methods

## Summary
Create a method `leap_year?` that accepts an integer representing a year as input.

It should return `true` if the year input is a leap year and `false` otherwise.

For example,

```ruby
leap_year?(2000) # => true
leap_year?(2001) # => false
```
