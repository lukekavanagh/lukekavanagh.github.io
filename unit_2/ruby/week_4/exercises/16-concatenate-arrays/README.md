# Concatenate Two Arrays

## Learning Competencies
- Define a method that accepts and uses arguments
- Define local variables and methods
- Apply string, array, hash, and/or enumerable methods

## Summary
Define a method `array_concat` that takes two `Arrays` as arguments and returns a single `Array` produced by concatenating the arguments.

For example,

```ruby
array_concat([1,2,3], [4,5,6])   # => [1,2,3,4,5,6]
array_concat([10, 4], ["apple"]) # => [10, 4, "apple"]
```

Consider what you need to do to solve the challenge. You can write it down if it will help you, or you can move on to the next release.

## Release 1: Initial Solution
Code your solution in the [my_solution.rb](my_solution.rb) file.

## Release 2: Test
Run the tests to make sure your code passes!

Remember, type `rspec` followed by the spec file name (and make sure you are in the proper directory).

## Release 3: Refactor
Make any necessary changes based on the tests. Then run the tests again.

Make sure all the tests pass before moving on.

## Release 4: Publish
