# Define a method that returns a formatted address

## Learning Competencies
- Define a method that accepts and uses arguments
- Apply string, array, hash, and/or enumerable methods

## Summary
Create a method called `make_address` that accepts parameters for the `street`, `city` , `state`, and `zip`  and returns a single address string.

For example if we call the method as follows:

```ruby
make_address("633 Folsom St.", "San Francisco", "CA", "94107")
```

The return value would be

```ruby
"You live at 633 Folsom St., in the beautiful city of San Francisco, CA. Your zip is 94107."
```

**Note**: the words your output that are not part of the method parameters must match exactly with the words in the output above.
