# Define a Hash

## Learning Competencies
- Define and access values in a hash

## Summary
Define a `Hash` variable called `my_info` which has the following keys:

* `:first_name`
* `:last_name`
* `:hometown`
* `:age`

Use your own personal information to fill in the keys.  Make sure `:age` is a positive integer and the rest are non-empty `Strings`.

The `Hash` needs to be stored in the `my_info` variable.

Then, access the values for each key in the hash. So you should be able to return your information for each key.

## Releases

## Release 0: Pseudocode
Consider what you need to do to solve the challenge. You can write it down if it will help you, or you can move on to the next release.

## Release 1: Initial Solution
Code your solution in the [my_solution.rb](my_solution.rb) file.

## Release 2: Test
Run the tests to make sure your code passes!

Remember, type `rspec` followed by the spec file name (and make sure you are in the proper directory).

## Release 3: Refactor
Make any necessary changes based on the tests. Then run the tests again.

Make sure all the tests pass before moving on.

## Release 4: Publish
When your solution is passing all of the tests, commit and push your changes!
