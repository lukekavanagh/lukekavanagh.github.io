# Find the Smallest Integer in an Array

## Learning Competencies
- Define a method that accepts and uses arguments
- Apply string, array, hash, and/or enumerable methods
- Use conditional statements

## Summary
Write a method `smallest_integer` which takes as its input an `Array` of integers and returns the smallest integer in the `Array`.

For example:

```ruby
smallest_integer([1, 2, 3])       # => 1
smallest_integer([0, -10, 10])    # => -10
smallest_integer([-10, -20, -30]) # => -30
```

If the input `Array` is empty `smallest_integer` should return `nil`.
