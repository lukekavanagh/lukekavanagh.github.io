#Separate Numbers with Commas

## Learning Competencies
- Break down problems into implementable pseudocode
- Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content
- Use if/else statements, string methods, while/until loops

## Summary
Write a method `SeparateComma` which takes an integer as its input and returns a comma-separated integer as a string. 
 
Like this:

```cs
SeparateComma(1000)    
=> "1,000"  
SeparateComma(1000000)   
=> "1,000,000"  
SeparateComma(0)   
=> "0"   
SeparateComma(100)    
=> "100"   
```

*NOTE: Even if you are comfortable with regular expressions, do not use them in this challenge, it's all about the logic! 
And to understand how awesome they are we provided an extra solution demonstrating this.*

ToDo:

1. [Pseudocode](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md).  
2. Add and commit your changes.  
3. Write your best Initial Solution (Remember this is off of memory).  
4. Refactor the initial solution to pass the tests.  
5. Peek at the solution and if you dont understand something put a post on slack and start a discussion.  
6. Add, commit and push your code up to GitHub.  

Pro-Tip: Computers can be said to read through collections from left to write, this has to be taken into account when dealing with data sequances that go from right to left. eg positive nembers.
