#Intro to weeks 5-7
The structure of the next three weeks present you with a list of videos to watch from Microsoft Virtual Academy C# fundamentals course, a list of EDA C# challenges and a list of stretch videos on PluralSight.

Expectations are that you make it through the videos on MVA and the challenges. The stretch videos are there for you to watch if you have time.

While watching the videos on Virtual Academy it may be helpful to open Visual Studio and follow along. Also note that the tutorials are screen casts of Visual Studio 2010, which differs slightly in the user interface. Its ok you just want to be focusing on the code. If you do bump into an oddity please reach out on slack for guidance.

You will be using Visual Studio to solve the challenges provided, all of which have tests that you will run to determine if your code is performing as expected. Visual Studio is the industry IDE of choice for C#, so you will need to become familiar with it over your time at EDA.

Before getting started on the challenges please look over the file  
[Anatomy of an EDA C# VS Challenge](challenge-anatomy.md)

PluralSight is a treasure trove of information and learning opportunities - we have put together some videos to watch but feel free to look for others and share any recommended ones via slack.

#Week 5: Algorithms

This week you will be working on writing command-line programs focusing on algorithms and basic testing. 

##Microsoft Virtual Academy

Watch these chapters of the tutorial:

- [Chapters 1-8 of C# fundamentals for absolute beginners](http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners?prid=ch9courselink)

Note: you can change the speed of the playback

##The Challenges
You can use the ii (Invoke-Item) command to open a Visual Studio solution file. Inside the exercise folder you will find a list of directories, each being one of the challenges for the week. navigate into the desired folder and type something like:
```
ii solution_name.sln   
```

- Numbers in range  
- Calculate median
- Find mode
- Pad array
- nums to commas
- cipher challenge
