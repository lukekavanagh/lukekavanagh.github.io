Once you've completed the exercise, copy the code you wrote into the [my_solution_define_empty_method.cs](my_solution_define_empty_method.cs) file of this folder, add, commit and push!

### Release 2: Exercise - Formatting a String

Open the [Formatting a String](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/5) exercise on NET REPL and complete it following the instructions on the page.

Once you've completed the exercise, copy the code you wrote into the [my_solution_format_string.cs](my_solution_format_string.cs) file of this folder, add, commit and push!

### Release 3: Exercise - Valid Triangles

Open the [Simple String Methods](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/6) exercise on NET REPL and complete it following the instructions on the page.

Once you've completed the exercise, copy the code you wrote into the [my_solution_valid_triangles.cs](my_solution_valid_triangles.cs) file of this folder, add, commit and push!

### Release 4: Exercise - Defining Basic Arithmetic Operations

Open the [Basic Arithmetical Operations](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/7) exercise on NET REPL and complete it following the instructions on the page.

## Release 5: Reflect
In your [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) use the [reflection guidelines](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md) to reflect on your learning. Remember, reflections should be directed toward an audience, but they don't need to be lengthy. A short paragraph will suffice. Try to keep your reflection writing to 10-15 minutes.
