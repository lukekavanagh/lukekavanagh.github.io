#U1.W3: Numbers, Letters, and Variable Assignment

## Learning Competencies
- Add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers
- Compare integers and floats
- Identify and use strings
- Define local variables

## Summary
These challenges introduce basic concepts like arithmetic operators and variables.

For many challenges in the C# stream of Phase 0 you will be using a custom made [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) environment, called NET REPL.

## Releases

### Release 0

Head over to Enspiral's [NET REPL](http://net-repl.enspiral.info) 

* Username: devacademy
* Password: iamnice

Review the first two [Labs](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/labs):

* Introduction
* Primitives

Consulting documentation and reading example code is an integral part of being a developer, so make sure to re-read the Labs as your work through the following coding challenges.

### Release 1: Summarize

Go to the [my_solution.md](my_solution.md) file associated with this challenge. Go to the numbers section and answer the questions in the "summary" section.

### Release 2: Exercise - Variable Names

Open the [Variable Names](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/1) exercise on NET REPL and complete it following the instructions on the page.

Once you've completed the exercise, copy the code you wrote into the [my_solution_variable_names.cs](my_solution_variable_names.cs) file of this folder, add, commit and push!

### Release 3: Exercise - Simple String Methods

Open the [Simple String Methods](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/2) exercise on NET REPL and complete it following the instructions on the page.

Once you've completed the exercise, copy the code you wrote into the [my_solution_simple_string_methods.cs](my_solution_simple_string_methods.cs) file of this folder, add, commit and push!

### Release 4: Exercise - Basic Arithmetical Operations

Open the [Basic Arithmetical Operations](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/3) exercise on NET REPL and complete it following the instructions on the page.

Once you've completed the exercise, copy the code you wrote into the [my_solution_basic_arithmetical_operations.cs](my_solution_basic_arithmetical_operations.cs) file of this folder, add, commit and push!

### Release 5: Reflect
Using the [Reflection Guidelines](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md), reflect on what you learned. Write your response in the "Reflection" section of your my_solution.md file.
