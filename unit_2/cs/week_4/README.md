#Introduction to C-Sharp

This weeks you get to play with C Sharp! (C#). The linked tutorials, labs and exercises will introduce you to the language and start to help you develop your C# utility belt for tackling the gravest of programming challenges.

Each week has a focus:
- Week 4: Fundamentals  
- Week 5: Algorithms  
- Week 6: Classes  
- Week 7: Objects  



When working through the material it may be helpful to talk to fellow students about what you have learned, work with another student on a problem or compare and discuss solutions you have completed. Reach out on slack and post links to code in stypie.

##Setup your CS dev machine - if you haven't already
These instructions assume you are working on a windows 7 or 8 machine. If you are working on a Mac, Linux or Windows Vista machine you will need to deploy your own development machine. We suggest using [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/platform) and [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/).

##Week 4: The Fundimentals

This week will have you using three tools
- [NET REPL](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/), a [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) made by EDA
- [PluralSight](http://www.pluralsight.com/), online videos
- [LinqPad](http://www.linqpad.net/), swiss army knife of features - but for now our sandbox environment. If you have not yet downloaded it please do so

Note the course used to be solely delivered via NET REPL. This is slowly being updated - in the meantime please follow the instructions below.

##To-Do
1. Watch the following videos on [C# from scratch](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/csharp-from-scratch)
	- Introduction
	- Fundamentals
	- Truth
2. Work through labs 1,2 & 3 on the [REPL](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/labs) - note: the valid triangle exercise is pretty tough, make sure you time box it. You can always come back to it.
3. Watch [Program Flow](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/csharp-from-scratch)
4. Work through lab 4 on the [REPL](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/labs) - note: the tests use the methods and check what is returned!
5. Watch [Arrays & Collections](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/csharp-from-scratch)
6.  Work through lab 5 on the [REPL](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/labs)
7. Optional - watch some more vids :)
[PluralSight](http://www.pluralsight.com/)
