#How to LinqPad

Once you have LinqPad downloaded and running - fire it up and prepare to be amazed!

LinqPad does many things but for now we are going to use only two of the modes in Language:

1. C# Statement(s) - this is a small sandbox for running code snippets, you dont need to worry about using references, namespaces or even classes, it will run the code and check the syntax. So if you want to test a piece of code and see what it does - put it here with some Console.WriteLine(); in it.

2. C# Program - this is equivalent to what is running in the NETREPL and a Console Application in Visual Studio. 	Place your code in the main() method - this is effectively the starting point of your app. Add methods below to make them available to the main method, note LinqPad	is smart enough to know that there is a class around the main method and any other methods we add.
