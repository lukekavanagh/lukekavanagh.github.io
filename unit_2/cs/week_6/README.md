# Week 6: Classes

This week you will be working on creating C# and writing more driver test code. Please make sure to follow each step we ask you to do (write driver test code, pseudocode, initial solution, refactoring, reflection, and review). This week gets into more advanced concepts, so make sure you pair as often as you need to ensure you are able to learn efficiently and have fun doing it! You can pair on any challenge (except for solo challenges). You'll also want to take some time to research classes upfront before diving in if you are unfamiliar. There are a ton of great resources out there that will help with this. 


## Challenges
1. [Die Class 1: Numeric](1-die)
2. [Die Class 2: Arbitrary Symbols](2-die)
3. [Build a Simple Guessing Game SOLO CHALLENGE](3-guessing-game)
